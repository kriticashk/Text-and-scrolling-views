<b>Text and scrollv view</b><br/>

<p>The Scrolling Text app demonstrates the ScrollView UI component. ScrollView is a ViewGroup that in this example contains a TextView. It shows a lengthy page of text—in this case, a music album review—that the user can scroll vertically to read by swiping up and down. A scroll bar appears in the right margin. The app shows how you can use text formatted with minimal HTML tags for setting text to bold or italic, and with new-line characters to separate paragraphs. You can also include active web links in the text.</p>

<b>Challenges</b><br/>

<p>Scrolling challenge is to add another UI element—a Button—to the LinearLayout inside the ScrollView so that it scrolls with the text. Use the text Add Comment for the Button.</p>
